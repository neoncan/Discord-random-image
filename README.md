Fun bot i made for my friend groups server

1. To get started, put your discord bot token into the "TOKEN" field

3. Put the channel id inbetween the parenthesis in "client.get_channel()" 
4. Run the _main_ script and your bot should be working.
5. In your desired channel write "!start" to start the bot and "!ssstop" to stop the bot
